        "Extremely Annotational RDF Markup is a meta-syntax for non-embedded markup that can be used for stand-off annotations of textual content with fully W3C-compliant technologies. EARMARK is based on an ontologically precise definition of markup that instantiates the markup of a text document as an independent OWL document outside of the text strings it annotates, and through appropriate OWL and SWRL characterizations it can define structures such as trees or graphs and can be used to generate validity constraints (including co-constraints currently unavailable in most validation languages)."@en ;

Note that these ranges allow to define (considering the string 'a devil' as content of a docuverse as example):
- document-order ranges, i.e., those ranges that has the begin location lesser than the end location (e.g., begin = 2, end = 7, content result 'devil');

This kind of range allows to define specific positions, as explained for the class 'PointerRange', within the concatenation of strings obtained by applying the xpath context to the docuverse the range refers to, as introduce in the class 'XPathRange'.

For instance, considering the following docuverse content:

<root><p>No devil </p><p>lived on</p></root>

the range defined on that docuverse as xpath_context = '//p', begin = '0', end = '17' refers to the text 'No devil lived on'.

NB: if we define a standard pointer range on the same docuverse using the same begin and end locations of the previous one, what we obtain as text will be '<root><p>No devil'."""@en ;

The semantics of this kind of range is the following:
1. assuming the content of the docuverse the range refers to as well-formed XML, we consider the sequence composed by the nodes obtained by running the xpath context (= a query) on the docuverse. If some non-nodes (e.g., strings, integers, etc.) is returned, it must be excluded from the sequence;
2. for each node in the sequence, we consider its 'value-of', i.e., the strings contained in all the text nodes reachable starting from the node itself;
